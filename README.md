# AoC-2020
 
Repository for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020. I have two regrets this year - on Day 13 I copy and pasted the Chinese Remainder Theorem code into my program. I should have been able to code it myself given its rules, yet I decided to possibly cheat (depends on what you count as cheating). The second regret is that I replaced or built upon my part 1 solutions with my part 2 solutions meaning that I don't have a record of them. 

I calculated the average execution time of each part 2 solution (given my own inputs):

Day | Avg Execution Time (s)
------------ | -------------
Day 1 | 4.32
Day 2 | 0.003
Day 3 | 0.001
Day 4 | 0.12
Day 5 | 0.002
Day 6 | 0.04
Day 7 | 0.06
Day 8 | 0.17
Day 9 | 3.28
Day 10 | 0.06
Day 11 | 11.5
Day 12 | 0.05
Day 13 | 0.06
Day 14 | 0.34
Day 15 | 20.2
Day 16 | 0.6
Day 17 | 242.5
Day 18 | 0.06
Day 19 | 0.02
Day 20 | 1.76
Day 21 | 0.02
Day 22 | 3.17
Day 23 | 51.9
Day 24 | 15.1
Day 25 | 38.3
