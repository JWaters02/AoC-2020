# AoC-2020
 
Repository for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020. I have two regrets this year - on Day 13 I copy and pasted the Chinese Remainder Theorem code into my program. I should have been able to code it myself given its rules, yet I decided to possibly cheat (depends on what you count as cheating). The second regret is that I replaced or built upon my part 1 solutions with my part 2 solutions meaning that I don't have a record of them. 

I calculated the average execution time of each part 2 solution (given my own inputs) alongside my time completion of puzzles (from 5am UTC start time) and my global rank for them:

\*I forgot about AoC on Day 1 and woke up 8 hours late.

\*\*I woke up 1 hour 30 minutes late. Then, in order to complete Day 25, you have to have finished all previous puzzles first. On Day 25, I had to finish Day 20 Part 2.
